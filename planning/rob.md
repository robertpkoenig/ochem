DEADLINE - 10th October

CURRENT
============================================
- test everything and fix except analytics (10)

NEXT
============================================
- double half headed arrow (5)
- get analytics working (10)
- add a hand button to the controller (1)
- refactor student module page
- teachers should see the module invite page as a preview

Refactor
- look into make the hover detector logic simpler
- see if I can split up the p5 stuff into a seperate package
- add linting rules, including tailwind
- refactor the ReactionStepLoader
- remove the 'functions' folder or something, it's just weird
- remove all classes, make everything just functions
- if showing image inside a square button, just make that part of the children
- get everything to 2 space tab


Feature ideas
- special feedback for certain wrong arrows
- hint for each step
- contextual questions that are optional
- explenation for each step
- for each reaction, have an explenation page where the student can just quickly read about it
- link(s) in each reaction page to outside resources
