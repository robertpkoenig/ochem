lone pairs

WHERE I AM

- 

- adjust overall layout of the student and teacher page so that notifications are on the page, and the canvas is not constrained

- option to add lone pairs, and make them a clickable target (16)
- bulk atom moves with shift select or click drag (8)

Refactor
- look into make the hover detector logic simpler
- see if I can split up the p5 stuff into a seperate package
- add linting rules, including tailwind
- refactor the ReactionStepLoader
- remove the 'functions' folder or something, it's just weird
- remove all classes, make everything just functions
- if showing image inside a square button, just make that part of the children
- get everything to 2 space tab
