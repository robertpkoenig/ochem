lone pairs

WHERE I AM

- 
- student lone pair hover
- adjust overall layout of the student and teacher page so that notifications are on the page, and the canvas is not constrained
- add a hand button to the controller (1)
- additional help explaining how curly arrows are drawn (3)
- add option for hint for each step (5)
- get analytics working (10)
- test everything and fix (10)
- take screenshots and ask steve best option for bond length



Refactor
- look into make the hover detector logic simpler
- see if I can split up the p5 stuff into a seperate package
- add linting rules, including tailwind
- refactor the ReactionStepLoader
- remove the 'functions' folder or something, it's just weird
- remove all classes, make everything just functions
- if showing image inside a square button, just make that part of the children
- get everything to 2 space tab


Feature ideas

- special feedback for certain wrong arrows
- contextual questions that are optional
- explenation for each step
- for each reaction, have an explenation page where the student can just quickly read about it
- link(s) in each reaction page to outside resources
-
